In vs code

Install extention 'Run on Save' (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave)(added to workspace recomendations)

Extention will execute helper.py ONLY WHEN ANY FILE IS SAVED (ctrl + s), not when file created / deleted!!!

helper.py will update settings.json (./src/settings.json) and create missing .html/.css/.js files
